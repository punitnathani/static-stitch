    <h3>Sustainability</h3>
    <p>
      Fashion industry has a massive debt to ecology. And fast fashion is just a faster way to worsen the impact.
      We source our materials locally and have taken a pledge to go plastic-free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our fabric products are designed to be reusable and washable.
      Sometimes, we do send little scraps of fabric and encourage our customers to come up with creative ways to use them.

    <h3>Zero Waste</h3>
    <p>
      We can't get sustainable with creating a lot of waste.
      Right from the process of sourcing materials to tailoring them(pun intended) to your needs to the packaging,
      we take utmost care to minimise the impact on the environment and take control of our carbon footprint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reduce. Reuse. Recycle.
