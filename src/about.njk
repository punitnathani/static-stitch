    <h3>Story</h3>
    <p>
      With a bright future ahead in consulting, I had an insight and mountains got me calling.
      They were home. Literally. I hail from a small town, right at the foothills of the Himalayas in the North-Eastern India.
      Known for its best tea in the world, Darjeeling is lush with green fauna & beautiful hillscapes with a sight to behold.

      Our fabric is sourced from the nearby areas including Tibet, Bhutan and some land of the mystics.

    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
      A book-hoarder, an eco-warrior, a dog-lover, a rebel. I go by many names.

    <h3>Invictus by William Ernest Henley</h3>
    <pre>
Out of the night that covers me,
      Black as the pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
      For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance
      I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
      My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
      Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
      Finds and shall find me unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate,
      How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate,
      I am the captain of my soul.
